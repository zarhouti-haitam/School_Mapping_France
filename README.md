# School_Mapping_France
Hey Everyone , I am happy to share with you one of my projects :) =>
It's a lightweight web application that visualizes educational institutions in France using an interactive table and map. It allows users to:

Search and filter schools by region, city, type, sector, and school year

View key information such as student count and geographic location

Navigate through data with a responsive interface and pagination

Explore the schools directly on a Leaflet-powered map 

Built using JavaScript, HTML/CSS and leaflet.js Lib , this project was " passionaly " made by me  for a CS engineering school asignement  .
